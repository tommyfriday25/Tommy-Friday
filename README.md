## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Nigerian-born developer and entrepreneur based in the UAE.  
With a background in **Computer Science** and a recent **MBA Essentials** certificate from the University of Glasgow, I combine tech and business thinking to build tools that matter.

For over 5 years, I've experienced the real rental journey — and now I’m solving the pain points through Safe2Own.
